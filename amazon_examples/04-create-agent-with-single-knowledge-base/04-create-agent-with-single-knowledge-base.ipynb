In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.

For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world.

Once the status changes Completed, then you can view the job's report card.\\n\\nUnderstanding how the results of your model evaluation job that are saved in Amazon S3     Automated model evaluation job report cards (console)     In your model evaluation report card, you will see the total number of prompts in the dataset you provided or selected, and how many of those prompts received responses. If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.\\n\\n\", metadata=None, type='tool'),\n",

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.

For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\"},{\\\"content\\\":\\\"[{text=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"user\\\"},{\\\"content\\\":\\\"[{text=Thought: <thinking>(1)}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\"}]}\",\n",

Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix. For example:     { \\\"inputText\\\": \\\"\\\"\\\" You are a helpful assistant. Here are some information about my account: - There are 10,543 objects in S3 bucket. - No active EC2 instances.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\"},{\\\"content\\\":\\\"[{text=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"user\\\"},{\\\"content\\\":\\\"[{text=Thought: <thinking>(1) The User's goal is to understand the components of a Bedrock Guardrail.(2) No specific information has been provided yet.(3) The best action plan is to search the knowledge base for information about the components of a Bedrock Guardrail.(4) The next step is to execute the search.(5) The available action is GET__x_amz_knowledgebase_QVHUHUIFNN__Search.(6) This action requires a searchQuery parameter, which should be \\\\\\\"what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?\\\\\\\".(7) I have everything I need to execute the search.</thinking>}, {toolUse={input={searchQuery=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}, name=GET__x_amz_knowledgebase_QVHUHUIFNN__Search}}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\"},{\\\"content\\\":\\\"[{toolResult={toolUseId=tooluse_hUi0lh42SXqywm493CM8oQ, content=Here are search results in numbered order:<search_result>    <answer_part>    <text>        Specify the ARN of the guardrail in the guardrailIdentifier field and the version in the guardrailVersion field.

Follow the steps in the API tab of Test a guardrail. Specify the guardrailVersion that you want to use.     You can also use a guardrail with other features of Amazon Bedrock.     Topics     ? Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix. For example:     { \\\\\\\"inputText\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" You are a helpful assistant.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\",\"role\":\"assistant\"},{\"content\":\"[{text=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}]\",\"role\":\"user\"},{\"content\":\"[{text=Thought: <thinking>(1)}]\",\"role\":\"assistant\"}]}', 'traceId': 'b1d7e9e6-7081-4676-a0ca-53e4effb2d1d-0', 'type': 'ORCHESTRATION'}}\n",

Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix.

Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\",\"role\":\"assistant\"},{\"content\":\"[{text=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}]\",\"role\":\"user\"},{\"content\":\"[{text=Thought: <thinking>(1) The User\\'s goal is to understand the components of a Bedrock Guardrail.(2) No specific information has been provided yet.(3) The best action plan is to search the knowledge base for information about the components of a Bedrock Guardrail.(4) The next step is to execute the search.(5) The available action is GET__x_amz_knowledgebase_QVHUHUIFNN__Search.(6) This action requires a searchQuery parameter, which should be \\\\\"what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?\\\\\".(7) I have everything I need to execute the search.</thinking>}, {toolUse={input={searchQuery=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}, name=GET__x_amz_knowledgebase_QVHUHUIFNN__Search}}]\",\"role\":\"assistant\"},{\"content\":\"[{toolResult={toolUseId=tooluse_hUi0lh42SXqywm493CM8oQ, content=Here are search results in numbered order:<search_result>    <answer_part>    <text>        Specify the ARN of the guardrail in the guardrailIdentifier field and the version in the guardrailVersion field.

Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\n",

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\n",

Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix.

Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix. For example:     { \"inputText\": \"\"\" You are a helpful assistant. Here are some information about my account: - There are 10,543 objects in S3 bucket. - No active EC2 instances. Based on the above, answer the following question: Question: <amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz> How many S3 objects do I have in my bucket? </amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz> ...

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\"},{\\\"content\\\":\\\"[{text=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"user\\\"},{\\\"content\\\":\\\"[{text=Thought: <thinking>(1) The User's goal is to understand the components of a Bedrock Guardrail.(2) No specific information has been provided yet.(3) The best action plan is to search the knowledge base for information about the components of a Bedrock Guardrail.(4) The next step is to execute the search.(5) The available action is GET__x_amz_knowledgebase_QVHUHUIFNN__Search.(6) This action requires a searchQuery parameter, which should be \\\\\\\"what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?\\\\\\\".(7) I have everything I need to execute the search.</thinking>}, {toolUse={input={searchQuery=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}, name=GET__x_amz_knowledgebase_QVHUHUIFNN__Search}}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\"},{\\\"content\\\":\\\"[{toolResult={toolUseId=tooluse_hUi0lh42SXqywm493CM8oQ, content=Here are search results in numbered order:<search_result>    <answer_part>    <text>        Specify the ARN of the guardrail in the guardrailIdentifier field and the version in the guardrailVersion field.

Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\",\"role\":\"assistant\"},{\"content\":\"[{text=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}]\",\"role\":\"user\"},{\"content\":\"[{text=Thought: <thinking>(1) The User\\'s goal is to understand the components of a Bedrock Guardrail.(2) No specific information has been provided yet.(3) The best action plan is to search the knowledge base for information about the components of a Bedrock Guardrail.(4) The next step is to execute the search.(5) The available action is GET__x_amz_knowledgebase_QVHUHUIFNN__Search.(6) This action requires a searchQuery parameter, which should be \\\\\"what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?\\\\\".(7) I have everything I need to execute the search.</thinking>}, {toolUse={input={searchQuery=what are the components of a Bedrock Guardrail?}, name=GET__x_amz_knowledgebase_QVHUHUIFNN__Search}}]\",\"role\":\"assistant\"},{\"content\":\"[{toolResult={toolUseId=tooluse_hUi0lh42SXqywm493CM8oQ, content=Here are search results in numbered order:<search_result>    <answer_part>    <text>        Specify the ARN of the guardrail in the guardrailIdentifier field and the version in the guardrailVersion field.

Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix.

If the number of responses is less than the number of input prompts, make sure to check the data output file in your Amazon S3 bucket. It is possible that the prompt caused an error with the model and there was no inference retrieved. Only responses from the model will be used in metric calculations.     Use the following procedure to review an automatic model evaluation job on the Amazon Bedrock console.     1. Open the Amazon Bedrock console.     2. From the navigation pane, choose Model evaluation.     3. Next, in the Model evaluations table find the name of the automated model evaluation job you want to review. Then, choose it.     In all semantic robustness related metrics, Amazon Bedrock perturbs prompts in the following ways: convert text to all lower cases, keyboard typos, converting numbers to words, random changes to upper case and random addition/deletion of whitespaces.     Model evaluation job results 332Amazon Bedrock User Guide     After you open the model evaluation report you can view the summarized metrics, and the Job configuration summary of the job.     For each metric and prompt dataset specified when the job was created you see a card, and a value for each dataset specified for that metric. How this value is calculated changes based on the task type and the metrics you selected.     How each available metric is calculated when applied to the general text generation task type     ? Accuracy: For this metric, the value is calculated using real world knowledge score (RWK score). RWK score examines the model?s ability to encode factual knowledge about the real world. A high RWK score indicates that your model is being accurate.     ? Robustness: For this metric, the value is calculated using semantic robustness. Which is calculated using word error rate. Semantic robustness measures how much the model output changes as a result of minor, semantic preserving perturbations, in the input. Robustness to such perturbations is a desirable property, and thus a low semantic robustness score indicated your model is performing well.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Open the Amazon Bedrock console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/     2.

Here are the key points about Provisioned Throughput:- **Purchase Process**: You can purchase Provisioned Throughput for a base or custom model. The process involves specifying the model, the commitment term (no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months), and the number of model units (MUs) you wish to purchase.- **Commitment Options**: You can choose between no commitment, 1 month, or 6 months of commitment. Billing ends according to the commitment term you select.- **Supported Regions and Models**: Provisioned Throughput is supported in specific regions and for certain models. For example, in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, you can only purchase Provisioned Throughput for custom models with no commitment.- **Usage**: After purchasing Provisioned Throughput, you can use it to run model inference, either through the Amazon Bedrock console playground or by invoking the provisioned model via the API.- **Management**: You can manage your Provisioned Throughput by updating its name, associating it with a different model, or deleting it when no longer needed.For more detailed information, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</answer>}]\n",

Input tagging with Guardrails     ? Streaming response behavior     Input tagging with Guardrails     Input tagging allows you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by Guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply Guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed. By using input tagging with Guardrails, you can better control which parts of the input text should be processed by the Guardrails, ensuring that your generative AI applications adhere to your selected responsible AI policies and use cases.     Tag content for Guardrails     To tag content for Guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom tagSuffix. For example:     { \"inputText\": \"\"\" You are a helpful assistant. Here are some information about my account: - There are 10,543 objects in S3 bucket. - No active EC2 instances.
